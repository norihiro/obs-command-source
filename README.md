Dummy Source to Execute Command
===============================

This plugin provides a dummy source to execute arbitrary command when scene is switched.

## Current Features

* Execute command at following events.
  * Show (the scene is shown in either preview or program)
  * Hide (the scene is hidden so that no longer shown in neither preview nor program)
  * Activate (the scene goes to the program)
  * Deactivate (the scene goes from the program)

## Possible Usage

* Implementing custom tally lights.
* Control PTZ cameras by switching the scene.
  You may combine with CURL to send some commands.
* Start and stop a daemon program required for the scene.
* Trigger other operations through websocket at the event.
  A helper script is available at `tools/request-websocket.py`.
* Not limited to above.

## Planned Features

* Environmental variables or parametric arguments to pass more information
  * Scene name
  * Source name
  * Other sources in the same scene
* Support Mac OS X
  Currently this plugin is only tested on Linux and Windows.
